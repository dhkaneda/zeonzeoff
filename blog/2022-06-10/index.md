This write-up describes the first Gundam plastic model custom build and is the debut build for my alias, zeonzeoff.

Build duration: *Nov 2020 - June 2022. Approx 20 months*

I grew up without money for toys and coveted model kits like these. The very few I got my hands on were second-hand, incomplete, and often counterfeit. Now in my late twenties, with some income and stability, I find I've earned some time to devote to this hobby.

With this build, I wanted it to be an exercise to learn the craft of plastic model building with Bandai's popular Mobile Suit Gundam kits.

Specifically, I aimed to learn by copying the techniques I saw others before me perform. I took some great ideas from Gunpla builder, **白用感叹号**, and their **HGFC Gundam Nobel > RX-78-2** conversion build. For convenience, I'll showcase some of it here. Along the way, I made some of my own design decisions due to personal taste and my own skill/tool limitations. I will compare all future builds to this one and use it as a reference point for my improvement.

## Inception phase

In the last year, I purchased and built a few inexpensive High Grade 1:144 scale mobile suits. This build with highlights a kit that it is the first one I wanted to modify. I lurked on Reddit's **r/Gunpla** and Pinterest for too long a time trying to plan a nice mistake-free procedure for my own build. In the end, I made tons of mistakes anyway.

In programming, we usually start learning a language and test its compiler and runtime with a "Hello World" program. For Gunpla, that's starting with the iconic and titular **RX-78-2**.

***The Gundam.***

It was the mobile suit I saw everywhere growing up. At first, I specifically avoided it and thought it was too common. A bit older now, I think it's fitting to have my own RX-78-2. After watching the original TV series, its classic design has grown on me.

This build log/description serves as  personal documentation. I invite anyone who has any ways to expedite my build journey by sending advice, tips, and comments. I would be grateful. Smarter people than me said to document everything and to learn publicly.

### Ace Pilot Gunpla's MS. GM

Browsing Reddit and Pinterest somehow brought me to Ace Pilot Gunpla's MS. GM custom build. I think this build is very creative and well executed. Please read more about it here: [MS. GM](https://acepilotgunpla.com/2020/07/15/ms-gm/).

I learned that there were mobile suits that had more feminine design language, shape, and stance. The omnipresent RX-78-2 popped into my head and thus, the idea for my build was born. Similar to Ace Pilot, I'd use a Nobel Gundam as a base and convert into an RX-78-2. It would be my Hello World Gunpla project.

Wary that it was probably not a new idea, I searched "Gundam Nobel Customs" on and eventually stumbled upon this build by **白用感叹号**.

All of these photos belong to 白用感叹号.

The best way I knew to learn is to copy and steal from the masters, or at least someone much better than myself. I was a little bummed that I wasn't the first to consider this build idea but also relieved that it was done so well, and I could use it as reference for my own build.

## Custom Training Regimen

By trying to copy this build, I would force myself to:

- **Practice** - skills I developed prior from carpentry and scale model building in architecture school and later profession

  - building new forms

  - Putty sculpting

  - PLA plating

  - 3D printing

- **Learn** - to do for the first time a lot of finishing techniques by hand

  - airbrush

  - scribe

  - light weathering and panel lining

  - apply water slide decals

All possible with basic entry level tools.

Copying better projects and products is a great way to improve my skills and pushed me to adapt and grow in areas I'd never encountered before.

I just tried not to break the bank so that I wouldn't resent my mistakes.
